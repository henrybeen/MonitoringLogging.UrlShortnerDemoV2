# MonitoringLogging.UrlShortnerDemoV2

To run this demo:
1. Create two new Azure resource groups. One will run the main example, the other the 'loadgen'
2. Deploy the two Bicep templates from the `LoggingMonitoring.Deployment` project into the correct resource groups
3. Open the code in Visual Studio and publish the two function apps to the correct resource group

Give it about 5 - 10 minutes and you should see the first data flowing in
